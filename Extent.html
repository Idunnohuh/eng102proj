    <h3>Who is affected?</h3>
    <p>
      Housing insecurity affects every working-class American. Every single person who has to work to live can be subject to loosing their house, no matter their current wealth.

  <div class="history-card extent-photo-2">
    <h3>The Working Class</h3>
    <p>
      Whether they are middle or lower class, any American who has to work to live can be pushed out onto the streets at any time. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="history-card extent-photo-3">
    <h3>The Elderly</h3>
    <p>
      Those on fixed incomes, such as the elderly, are especially vulnerable to losing their homes, as politicians and bankers continue to gut social security. 
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="history-card extent-photo-4">
    <h3>The Already Homeless</h3>
    <p>
      People on the streets are far less likely to be able to return to stable housing, continuing the cycle of homelessness.
